# Nicotine and Glucose Study: The Islands Simulation

This GitHub repository presents the "Nicotine and Glucose Study" conducted through "The Islands" simulation by the University of Queensland. Our team investigated the effects of nicotine on blood glucose levels and depressive symptoms, aiming to provide valuable insights into the health impacts of nicotine consumption.

## Study Overview

The study, set in "The Islands" simulation environment, explored the relationship between nicotine intake, blood glucose levels, and depressive symptoms among individuals aged 40-80. We hypothesized that nicotine consumption would increase both glucose levels and depressive symptoms.

## Methods and Results

- Multistage sampling from "The Islands" population.
- Blood glucose and depressive symptoms measured pre- and post-nicotine/placebo treatment over 14 days.
- Data analysis using Two-way ANOVA and regression.

## Key Findings

- Weak correlation between nicotine intake and changes in blood glucose and depressive symptoms.
- Inconclusive results due to sample size and variability; further research suggested.

## Limitations and Ethical Considerations

- Study limitations include sampling biases and potential confounding factors.
- Ethical considerations of nicotine administration addressed through the simulated environment of "The Islands."
